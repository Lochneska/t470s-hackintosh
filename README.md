# t470s-hackintosh
Near perfect hackintosh EFI for the Lenovo Thinkpad T470S, currently only tested on Ventura 13.6. :)

BIG, BIG shoutout to MultimediaLucario - a rather large part of my EFI comes from his. Please check out his page, as it contains an amazing initialization guide, and post install tips too. (I especially recommend undervolting!) :)

My specs:
Thinkpad T470s (duh :P)
Intel Core i5-7300u 
4gb soldered, 4gb SODIMM DDR4 RAM.
512gb Crucial P3 SSD

Obviously I have made some modifications, not sure if these apply to the T470, but they sure do for the T470s:

- Fixed Bluetooth - just works now.
- Fixed WIFI taking ages to connect upon bootup + just completely dying after the laptop went through sleep/wake.
- Updated kexts to be up to date to 30th September 2023.
- Thatâ€™s it. :)
