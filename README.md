# t470s-hackintosh
Near perfect hackintosh EFI for the T470S, currently only tested on Ventura 13.6. :)

BIG, BIG shoutout to MultimediaLucario - a rather large part of my EFI comes from his. Please checkout his page, as it contains an amazing initialization guide, and post install tips too (I especially reccomend undervolting). :)

Obviously I have made some modifications, not sure if these apply to the T470, but they sure do for the T470s:

- Fixed Bluetooth - just works now.
- Fixed WIFI taking ages to connect upon bootup + just completely dying after the laptop went through sleep/wake.
- Updated kexts to be up to date to 30th September 2023.
- Thatâ€™s it. :)
